Finding a good customized function for the instrumental profile (IP)
for a precise RV spectrograph is undoubtedly one of the most important
and difficult tasks in achieving a $<3$~m/s RV precision. IP modeling
is a crucial part of the precise RV work with iodine calibration, as
it affects directly several key procedures in the Doppler pipeline,
such as the creation of stellar spectrum template and the
forward-modeling of the observed stellar$+$iodine spectrum. The heroic
efforts of early \keck\ users pinned down its IP to a 12-parameter
sum-of-Gaussians profile, with two sets of 11 pre-determined positions
and width of the satellite Gaussians \citep{1995PASP..107..966V}. It
is the product of careful studies and numerous trials with IP
modeling.

It is very easy to imagine that imprecise and inaccurate IP modeling
could be the bottleneck for improving \het's RV precision. The ability
to capture the shape of the IP and {\em its changes} largely determines
how well the RV spectra are fitted, and thus how precisely the Doppler
shift is measured. The 3-4~m/s precision on HD 185144 we obtained
(Figure~\ref{het:fig:sigdra}) was the results of an ``out of the box''
reduction -- we had only modified the CPS Doppler code to the point
where it could process \het\ data, but we had not yet put in any
efforts to tune it for \het. The first step of such tuning would be to
find a better IP.

How well the IP is being modeled can be tested by fitting a pure
iodine spectrum taken by the spectrograph
(Figure~\ref{het:fig:convkernel}), with the continuum source being
either a lamp or a (mostly) line-free B star. Such spectra are often
referred to as the iodine spectra (or frames or flats), or the B star
iodine spectra. The typical $\chi_\nu^2$ value that we obtain for
fitting \het\ iodine spectra with a generic IP model (Gauss-Hermite
polynomials) is about 2-5, while for Keck/HIRES, the \chisq\ value is
typically around 1 (Figure~\ref{het:fig:iodchunkcomp}). The origin of
this difference in \chisq\ does not seem to rise from a
signal-to-noise difference in the spectra
(Figure~\ref{het:fig:checksnr}).

  suspect in contributing to the bad fits to \het\ iodine spectra.

The current ``go-to'' IP model for \hrs\ is the very versatile,
orthogonal, 11-parameter Gauss-Hermite polynomial (GH), which was
described in Chapter~\ref{chap:doppler}. Another customized IP for
\het\ was tried out by CPS using the sum of Gaussians, the same as
the one used for \keck\ but having the wings at different locations
with different default widths. The two IPs basically perform at a
similar level, with GH being slightly better
(Figure~\ref{het:fig:ghgau}). We have also tried several other
functional forms such as GH convolved with a top hat function with a
varying or fixed width, Lorentzian-Hermite (replacing the Gaussian in
GH with a Lorentzian), which all performed marginally worse than GH,
just like the sum of Gaussians. Or, more precisely, these IPs all seem
to be ``equally bad''.

  using different IPs (top panels), in this case, using GH and sum of

  having similarly large reduced $\chi^2$ but neither produces a
  satisfactory fit. It is also interesting to see how ``stable" the
  best-fit IP can be across the years (i.e., in 2005 vs.~2008) and its
  smoothness, hinting that the best IP may take a simple, slowly-varying form.

We then looked for clues in the Fourier space:
Figure~\ref{het:fig:fftip} plots the Fourier transform power spectrum
of the \het\ data (using the {\it fft} procedure in IDL) for the
entire $\sim$1000\AA\ 1-D extracted spectrum used for precise-RV
purposes; with \keck\ data also plotted for comparison). At high
frequency in Fourier space, or shorter periods in pixel space, i.e.\
on small scales, the power spectrum is dominated by the signature of
the IP. A ``null'' in the power spectrum at 4.3 pixel is clearly
visible, which suggests some sort of sharp feature, and indeed, it
exactly corresponds to the slit width of \het\ projected onto the
detector at a resolution of R $=$ 60,000. This feature is a direct
result of the fact that HRS has the slit in front of a round fiber,
creating somewhat of a sharp feature in its IP, unlike the slit-fed
\keck.

  is for \keck\ data, which shows no clear signature of a slit,
  because \keck\ is not fiber-fed and the PSF of the star falls mostly
  within its slit.

%----------------------------------------------------------------


Upon seeing the Fourier transform of the \het\ data, we tried out
another IP using GH multiplying a triangle (with a half width of 2.4
pixel and a height of 1), whose Fourier transform has a null at 4.3
pixel, and it produced the best fit among all IP models we have
ventured. Figure~\ref{het:fig:iodipcomp} illustrates this new fit in
comparison with the GH IP fit, although it was perhaps
still equally bad. At this point, we have already suspected that
the ``ground truth'' for the iodine lines, the iodine atlas, which was
created from an FTS scan, may be problematic. It would not be possible
to derive a correct form for the IP using a wrong iodine atlas, and
thus we shift our priority towards validating the iodine cell FTS and
investigating possible changes in the cell, which is described in the
next section.

\caption{Introducing a sharp feature into the \het\ IP model, a
  triangle on top of the GH IP (red curve in the left panel), produces
  a better fit, somewhat to our surprise. The black in the left panel
  is the best-fit GH IP. GH$+$triangle is the IP model that produces
  the least $\chi^2_\nu$ among all of our IP models. However, as shown
  by the right panel, the two fits barely have any visible difference
  (red curve for GH$+$triangle IP and black for GH; bottom panel plots
  the residuals). Such a sharp feature in the IP is nonphysical, and we
  interpret this results as a hint for an unreliable iodine atlas
  (the sharp peak at the center is perhaps the IP model trying to
  ``stretch" the iodine lines deeper; see Section~\ref{het:sec:fts}
  for more details).
\label{het:fig:iodipcomp}}
\end{figure}
%----------------------------------------------------------------


Besides the problem with the iodine atlas, which fundamentally
prevents us from finding a precise IP, we know for sure that the GH
function does not work very well \rev{mostly because of the fitter fails to
converge for this complicated function}. We have two lines of evidence
supporting this statement. The first one is that the GH IP performs
terribly on \keck\ data because the L-M least-\chisq\ fitter has
trouble converging (unless fine-tuned and informed from previous fits
using sum of Gaussians; \citealt{2013AAS...22114908V}). The second
piece of evidence is that we tried to fit GH to unsaturated ThAr lines
in \het\ calibration frames, and it often fails to converge onto a
good fit to the ThAr line. 

To end this section with a somewhat positive note, we present a
promising lead for a better IP function for \hrs, the modified Moffat
function:
\begin{equation}
[1+(x/\theta)^2]^{-\beta\cdot(x/\delta)^2}
\end{equation} 
It is called the ``modified" Moffat function because the original
Moffat function does not have the $(x/\delta)^2$ term. We added this
term to add flexibility at the wings to enable change of
characteristic IP width while preserving wing
profile. Figure~\ref{het:fig:moffat} illustrates the results using the
modified Moffat fitting a ThAr line (insert), and also the
$\chi^2_\nu$ distribution of all spectral chunks for this new IP
compared with the GH IP. Unfortunately, the modified Moffat function
does not always fit a ThAr line (starting with uninformed initial
guesses), so it faces the same problem as GH. However, it only has
four parameters and they are mostly physically meaningful. For
example, one can imagine that the $\theta$ parameter describes some
characteristic width. This makes this function easier to work with than
GH.

One can image getting a better fit by adding small perturbation terms
to the modified Moffat IP to account for asymmetries and subtle wings
due to scattered light. Moreover, the modified Moffat function is
potentially applicable to other fiber-fed instruments, since such
instruments are likely to have IPs with the same characteristic flat
top and sharp wings. We hope to continue this effort after the iodine
atlas problem is resolved (see next section) and carry on this
knowledge to other projects such as the new HRS and MINERVA
(Chapter~\ref{chap:conclusion}).
