% HET FTS

As discussed in the previous section, successful modeling of the
iodine observations (B star spectra taken through the iodine cell) is
a good indication of a working radial velocity (RV) pipeline. We have
explored one of the two model components for modeling iodine
observations, the choice of IP. In this section, we examine the other
model component, the iodine atlas, that is, the ``ground truth''
spectrum for the iodine absorption lines unique to the \het\ iodine
cell. A ``ground truth" iodine atlas is crucial for the precise iodine
radial velocimetry. It is used for modeling the observed iodine lines
in the stellar$+$iodine RV observation to anchor the absolute
wavelengths and the spectrograph response function. 


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Why did we suspect the iodine atlas?}

An iodine atlas is normally obtained using a Fourier Transform
Spectrometer (FTS; whose mechanism is just like a Michelson
interferometer). The scan and its subsequent data reduction provides
very high resolution spectrum (translated from Fourier space into real
space) with typically $R > 200,000$-500,000.\footnote{It is worth
noting here that although FTS normally provides wavelength solutions
(from the registered arm lengths), but because of the inaccuracy of
the default reported wavelengths, the final wavelength solution for
the iodine atlas is usually derived from a theoretically computed
iodine line list (e.g., \citealt{iodinespec5}).}

The existing iodine atlas for the \het\ cell is from an FTS scan taken
at the National Solar Observatory at KPNO using the Babar FTS
(nicknamed for its large size; this machine has been decommissioned)
in 1993. The main reason why we took a new scan is that the FTS scan
was taken almost two decades ago, and during this time the cell may
have gone through changes (such as temperature, leaking or
condensation, etc., though unlikely, since the cell was designed to be
stable). This would mean that the FTS scan is out of date and
inaccurate, and it could explain the bad fits to the iodine
observation.

\rev{Therefore, we arranged the HET/HRS cell to be sent to the National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) facility in Gaithersburg,
MD and obtained a new FTS scan in 2011. The work was done by Drs.\
Gillian Nave and Stephen Redman, in coordination with Drs.\ William
Cochran, Jason Wright, and Jeff Valenti.} A close comparison between
this new scan from NIST and the old scan at KPNO reveals that they
have many differences:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The overall line depths are very different --- the NIST scan
    has deeper lines.
  \item The absolute wavelength solutions are different, and the
    drifting of wavelength solution or the dispersion scales at
    different wavelength are also different.
  \item Even after we adjust the normalization level of the NIST
    scan (assuming the FTS data has normalization issues or low
    frequency noise/offset), the line ratios of the two scans still
    exhibits differences.
\end{itemize}

Figure~\ref{fig:fts_old_new} shows the comparison between the two
scans in a selected 2\AA\ region. As the two scans also differ in
resolution (the NIST scan has a higher resolution), the middle panel
is a more direct comparison: the NIST scan has been convolved down to
the same resolution with the KPNO scan; it is also shifted in
wavelength space so that the two scans match in absolute wavelength
solution; and it is adjusted to a different normalization level to
match with the KPNO scan as much as possible in order to compare their
relative line ratios.

We initially suspected that the NIST scan was problematic. The reason is
illustrated in the left panel of Figure~\ref{fig:chisq_old_new}, where
it shows the histogram of \chisq\ values for fitting an selected iodine
observation using the two scans, respectively. Each \chisq\ value is
for a 2\AA\ chunk in this selected iodine observation. It is clear
that the NIST scan provides worse fits.

\caption{Both plots are histograms of \chisq\ values of a single

  hundred of chunks and is fitted independently).

  \textbf{Left:} \chisq\ histograms for the fit of the iodine

  \textbf{Right:} \chisq\ histograms for the two scans, but both with
  the normalization as a free parameter for each chunk (as we suspect
  the NIST scan has problems in normalization). The two scans now

  red histogram as plotted in the left panel. Notably, the KPNO scan
  also performs better when we float the normalization parameter.
  \label{fig:chisq_old_new}}
\end{figure*}
%----------------------------------------------------------------


Since the direct comparison between the KPNO scan and the NIST scan
has hinted that the normalization of the NIST scan might be
problematic, we decide to add a free parameter to account for this
normalization error when fitting the iodine observation. The right
panel of Figure~\ref{fig:chisq_old_new} shows the \chisq\ histograms
for the same iodine observation using the two scans, but adding a free
parameter as the normalization when fitting each chunk (note: the
normalization parameter is a free parameter for each chunk, not a
global single parameter). The two scans now perform at essentially the
same level.

This is both encouraging and worrisome at the same time. It is
encouraging because it seems that we have found the problem with the
NIST scan, and also have a solution for it. It is very worrisome
because this reveals that:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Even the KPNO cell performs visibly better when we float the
    normalization parameter. This may suggest that there are
    normalization issues or low frequency errors/noise in the KPNO
    scan as well.
  \item Obtaining high-quality, reliable FTS scans of iodine cell is
    very difficult, and the FTS scans cannot be naively trusted as the
    ``ground truth'' super accurate templates of the complicated iodine
    spectrum.
  \item The reason why adding a floating normalization fits the
    data better might be because it accounts for optical depths difference
    between the atlas and the actual observations, which may be a result
    of changes in cell temperature or iodine column density in the cell.
  \item The pipeline (when floating normalization as a free parameter)
    cannot distinguish which scan is more accurate (by \chisq)
    even when two scans differ as much as $\sim$5--10\% at places and
    also have obvious line ratio differences (see comparison in bottom
    panel of Figure~\ref{fig:fts_old_new}). However, this level of
    difference in FTS may affect the RV precision, and not knowing
    which atlas is the correct one definitely affects our ability to
    search for a better IP and improve the RV precision of \het.
\end{itemize}  

Perhaps even more alarmingly and more puzzling, when we use the KPNO
scan for the iodine cell used at Keck/HIRES to fit an HET/HRS iodine
observation, it yields smaller \chisq\ values than using any of the
other two scans (Figure~\ref{fig:lampi2fit}). The \het\ cell KPNO scan
was taken at the same time using the same FTS machine as the \keck\
cell scan. However, the set-temperatures of these two cells are very
different: the \keck\ cell is designed to work at 50$\degree$C, while
the \het\ cell is designed to work at $70\degree$C. A closer look
reveals that the HET KPNO scan and the Keck KPNO scan have very
similar line depth, with Keck having slightly deeper lines (thus
higher iodine molecule column density).

%----------------------------------------------------------------

All of the facts above prompted us to seek a relatively
independent way to perform quality checks for any FTS scan --- not
just comparing their relative qualities or performances. One
natural choice is to obtain spectra taken with high-resolution echelle
spectrographs, which are measurements of the iodine spectrum directly
in the real wavelength space instead of in the Fourier space, and
thus they serve as good reference spectra as they suffer from
different types of error compared to FTS. Since FTS scans are usually
at a very high spectral resolution ($200,000$--$500,000$), this limits
our choice to essentially only one spectrograph --- the TS12 setting
of the Tull Spectrograph at the 2.7m Telescope at McDonald.

Our goal is to answer the question of {\bf which FTS scan better describes
the \het\ iodine cell: the KPNO one, or the NIST one? Why?} While adding an
additional normalization parameter can provide better fits for the
iodine frames, we cannot afford to add such an additional parameter
when extracting RVs from star$+$iodine data -- this normalization
parameter is highly degenerate with Doppler shift and wavelength
solution parameters, and it will undoubtedly decrease the RV
precision. Another key question is {\bf why the FTS scan for the \keck\
cell works the best.}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Ultra-High Resolution Echelle Spectra of Iodine Cells}

To break the tie between various FTS scans, we used the TS12 setting
of the Tull Spectrograph at the 2.7m Telescope at McDonald
Observatory, which provided a resolution of 500,000 (based on ThAr
line measurements done by David Doss at McDonald). 

We had two rounds of TS12 runs, both during day time and when the
telescope was scheduled for Cassegrain instrument and the Tull
Spectrograph room was free for use. For the first run (from September
7 to September 9, 2013; done by Ming Zhao and the author) we measured
the iodine absorption spectrum for the iodine cell at the Sandiford
(2.1m) Telescope, because the HET/HRS cell was unavailable (it was
still under active use for planet search programs not long before we
did this test). The main purpose of the first run was to validate the
quality of the TS12 spectrum and whether we can use it to
cross-validate the FTS scans. The Sandiford cell also has a KPNO FTS
scan which was taken together with the KPNO scan of the HET cell in
1993, so it also serves the purpose of testing the overall quality of
the KPNO scans.

In the second TS12 run, we measured the spectrum for the \het\ iodine
cell in its new enclosure and temperature controller (along with the
MINERVA iodine cell and the iodine cell on McDonald Harlan J.\ Smith
2.7m telescope; from October 13 through October 16, 2014; carried out
by Ming Zhao, Kim Star, and Joey Schmitt). Our TS12 runs are enabled
by Anita Cochran, Bill Cochran, Phillip MacQueen, and the astronomers
who used the Cassegrain instruments at night (VIRUS-W for the first
run and IGRINS for the second), with great help and excellent
engineering support from David Doss and Coyne Gibson at McDonald
Observatory.

The hardware settings and data reduction methods are the same for both
runs, which are described below.

\textbf{\textit{Hardware Settings:}} We used the TS12 arm of the Tull
Spectrograph, and the specific instrument choices are listed in
Table~\ref{tab:hardware}. Slit \#23 is chosen to maximize SNR while
maintaining sufficient resolution --- it is among the longest slit and
is also the second narrowest slit. The Sandiford cell was kept at a
temperature of 49.9--50.1$^\circ$C, the same as its working
temperature for RV work and its temperature when the KPNO was taken
(50$\degree$C). The \het\ cell was measured at four different
temperatures: room temperature, 50$\degree$C, 60$\degree$C, and
70$\degree$C (its working temperature).

\textbf{\textit{Observation:}} A single exposure frame for the iodine
spectrum covers about 1.9\AA\ (Figure~\ref{het:fig:ts12image}). The
dispersion direction runs vertically along the chip with increasing
wavelength when increasing the $y$-axis pixel. The dispersion scale is
about 0.002\AA\ per pixel ($\sim$7 pixels per resolution element). We
immediately preceded or followed each exposure with a flat fielding
frame. The exposure times for the iodine and flat frames are both 45
seconds (90 seconds for \het\ cell) to achieve a signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) of 160 per pixel (higher for \het\ cell). Neighboring frames
differ by about 1\AA\ in absolute wavelength. If prominent Solar or
ThAr line was predicted within the wavelength coverage of a frame,
then we also took a Solar or ThAr frame to verify the rough wavelength
solution (the exposure time varied --- typically a couple minutes to
up to 10 minutes). We took dark frames (45s each, about 10 frames) in
the morning at the beginning of each day.

\end{figure}
%----------------------------------------------------------------


\textbf{\textit{Reduction:}} We combined and averaged all available
dark frames and created a master dark frame. Then we subtracted the
master dark from all flat and iodine frames. After outlier rejection
(cosmic rays, chip defects, etc.), we modeled the scattered light for
each row of pixels by using the region outside the slit image.  We
stacked 160 neighboring rows and fitted a third order polynomial along
the column, and then interpolated for the amount of scattered light
within the slit image region and subtracted it. Both the flat and
iodine frames have scattered light removed. Then we normalized the
flat frames and divided each iodine frame by its associated normalized
flat (for the slit image regions only).

\textbf{\textit{Extraction:}} As the slit does not lie perfectly along
the $x$-axis direction on the chip, we corrected for this by cutting
columns along the dispersion direction and cross-correlating the
columns. Then we interpolated and shifted the columns to create an
aligned image, which we stacked along the $x$-axis direction and
obtained the reduced, extracted spectrum. Each spectrum is then
normalized by dividing the estimated continuum (top 5\% counts). Due
to lower quality of scattered light removal near the edge of the chip,
we discarded the top 80 and bottom 80 rows of pixels. Thus the
extracted spectrum from each frame is about 1.6\AA\ across (instead of
1.9\AA). The reduced frames are then stitched together by finding
the overlapping region through cross correlation for each pair of
neighboring frames and taking into account the changes and differences
of dispersion scales across frames.
\begin{comment}
For the overlapping region, the spectrum in the bluer frame is
`projected' onto the redder frame by taking into account the changes
and differences in pixel dispersion scales in the two frames. The
overlapping spectral region in the stitched spectrum thus has the
dispersion scale of the redder frame, but it preserves the
normalization of the bluer frame. This way the two frames are stitched
together.
\end{comment}

\textbf{\textit{Mapping onto FTS:}} To compare with the FTS
scans, we chopped the TS12 spectrum into 2\AA\ chunks and project
each chunk onto the FTS spectrum by cross correlation. In this way we
obtained the absolute wavelength solution and dispersion scale (as set
by the wavelength solution of the FTS scan) for the TS12
spectrum.

The results from our first TS12 run using the Sandiford cell
demonstrated that an iodine cell spectrum taken with TS12 has the same
quality as an FTS scan to serve as the `true solution' of the iodine
spectrum. The left panel of Figure~\ref{fig:ts12} shows a direct
comparison of the reduced TS12 spectrum (a random 2\AA\ chunk) with
the KPNO FTS scan, at their native resolutions.\footnote{Note that the
TS12 spectrum appears to have a higher resolution than the FTS
scan. According to the header of the FTS scan, its resolution is about
$491,000$. An FFT analysis on the TS12 spectrum (to see where the
high-frequency signal cuts off and becomes indistinguishable from the
noise) shows that its resolution is about $455,000$ and maybe even
higher.}

To make a more direct comparison and also to see the differences of
the two spectra (if any) would make a significant impact when fitting
a $60,000$ resolution iodine observation, we degraded the resolution
of both spectra to $60,000$ by convolving them with a Gaussian of a
proper width. The right panel of Figure~\ref{fig:ts12} illustrates the
comparison of the two spectra at $R\sim60,000$, with residuals of the
TS12 spectrum minus the KPNO FTS spectrum plotted in the bottom
panel. The two spectra differ by a median absolute deviation of 0.3\%
($0.4\%$ for the entire $\sim$30\AA\ spectrum available as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:60k_all}).\footnote{ For comparison: when fitting the
HET/HRS Iodine observation used for creating
Figure~\ref{fig:chisq_old_new} (median SNR for a typical chunk is
$\sim$150, or 0.65\% shot noise), for a typical chunk, the median
absolute deviation between the observation and the best-fit model is
0.73\% (the RMS value is 1\%, thus \chisq\ is $\sim 2$--$3$).  } As
the TS12 spectrum has a SNR of about 160 and we have convolved the
comparison spectrum down to $R\sim60,000$, the expected shot noise
should be $\sim 1/160\times \sqrt{450,000/60,000}=0.23\%$. The
additional $\sim 0.1\%$--$0.2\%$ of noise may come from flat fielding,
scattered light removal, cosmic ray removal and interpolation between
pixels, stitching of spectra, projection onto the FTS spectrum and
interpolation for comparison purposes, and so on.

%----------------------------------------------------------------


After demonstrating that we can use TS12 spectrum to validate FTS
scans, we performed our second TS12 run with the \het\ cell (and the
2.7m cell and the MINERVA cell). For
the 2.7m cell, its TS12 spectrum matches very well to its FTS atlas,
again (together with the 2.1m cell data from 2013) proving that TS12
is an appropriate tool for validating FTS atlases. For the HET/HRS
iodine cell, the results are very informative:

(1) Assuming that the \het\ cell temperature control was reliable
during our TS12 run (Phillip MacQueen from McDonald Observatory, who
built the cell and its enclosure, was at the TS12 run to set it up),
then temperature change on the order of 5--10$\degree$C in iodine cell
should induce a visible change in the absorption spectrum (right panel
of Figure~\ref{het:fig:tempchange}). On the other hand, the
temperature of the iodine gas in the cell was not at its set
temperature of $70\degree$C during the NIST scan (left panel of
Figure~\ref{het:fig:tempchange}). This could explain the difference
between \het\ cell's NIST scan and the KPNO scan. The NIST scan
appears to have stayed at higher than $70\degree$C the entire time
(one hypothesis is that the gas on the light path was heated up by the
ultra-luminous continuum lamp, while the glass container, which the
temperature probe was monitoring, stayed cool). The \keck\ cell was
also scanned at three different temperatures (50, 60, and
70$\degree$C) at KPNO in 1993, and there are also visible differences
between these three sets of scans.

%----------------------------------------------------------------



(2) The TS12 spectrum at $70\degree$C matches better with the more
recent but potentially problematic NIST FTS atlas
(Figure~\ref{het:fig:hetts12}). This is completely unexpected and
contradicts with the assumptions and/or conclusions we lay out in
finding (1). The TS12 spectrum also does not match the FTS scan well
enough given the high SNR nature of both. Perhaps neither TS12 or the
NIST scan was at $70\degree$C. Or, perhaps the amount of iodine vapor
was somehow different.

These results prompted us to resolve for a second route to try to break
the tie: using synthetic iodine absorption spectra, which is described
in the next subsection.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Measuring iodine cell temperatures using synthetic Iodine spectra}

Using the TS12 spectra, we found that the temperature of the iodine
gas in the cell might not be the same one reported by the temperature
controller. However, we still could not break the tie between the KPNO
scan and the NIST scan for \het\ cell: the KPNO scan provides a better
fit to real observed data, but the TS12 spectrum shows us that the
NIST scan looks closer to the ``truth'' as defined by TS12. Nor did we
understand why the KPNO scan for the \keck\ cell works the best for
\het\ data.

To answer these questions, we have found\footnote{The author is deeply
  grateful for Iouli Gordon for introducing IodineSpec5
  during her visit at CfA.} a second venue that provides
reliable, ultra-high resolution, and wavelength calibrated iodine
atlas -- a theoretical code that computes synthetic iodine
transmission spectrum (at any specified temperature) based on both
physics and empirical calibrations (IodineSpec5;
\citealt{iodinespec5}). We emailed the authors and obtained the code,
which only runs on Windows machines. The direct output of the code
contains arrays of wave numbers and effectively, opacity ($\alpha$) for user-specified
iodine isotope mix (for our purposes we only add $^{127}I_2$),
temperature, wave number range, and line broadening kernel parameter
(we chose thermal/Gaussian). To use the output of IodineSpec5 to fit
an actual iodine absorption spectrum, there are two parameters:
gas temperature and a constant which scales with iodine molecule
column density, which we simply refer to as the column density hereafter.

Quickly comparing the NIST scan with the IodineSpec5 models reveals
that the NIST scan seems to be around 110$\degree$C, mostly based on
visually examining the line ratios
(Figure~\ref{het:fig:nisteyeball}). However, the synthetic iodine
spectrum and the FTS scans have different broadening kernels. In order
to ``fit'' the NIST scan with the synthetic spectra at various
temperatures, we convolved the NIST scan with a single Gaussian kernel
with $\sigma=0.0078$ (roughly at $R=$ 200,000 to try to match the
\keck\ cell KPNO scan for comparison and illustration
purposes). Except for the \keck\ scan, we did the same to lower the
resolution of other FTS scans or TS12 spectra when using IodineSpec5
to find out their temperatures. There are four parameters in our
fit: temperature, column density, resolution ($\sigma$ for the single
Gaussian kernel to convolve the synthetic spectrum with), and a
wavelength shift. We first optimized the column density, $\sigma$, and
the wavelength shift while fixing the temperature (using L-M
least-$\chi^2$ fitter using {\tt mpfitfun} package in IDL), and then
we compare the goodness of fit of each model at different temperatures
to determine which temperature best describes the FTS scan or TS12
spectrum. The reason for this two-step optimization is because we have
to generate the IodineSpec5 model spectra on a discrete temperature
grid.

parameters for the theoretical lines: temperature and iodine column
density. For this plot, we optimized the iodine column density for the
theoretical lines at both temperatures to try to match the NIST FTS. As
illustrated, neither temperature can produce a good match, and the
best temperature is around 110$\degree$C. Note that the
theoretical lines and the NIST FTS have different broadening
kernels. The NIST and KPNO FTS scans probably differ in both optical
depth and cell temperature.

%----------------------------------------------------------------

We first fitted the \keck\ cell KPNO FTS scan, whose temperature is
known (50$\degree$C) and reliable. We also know that this FTS scan is
probably \rev{true to its reported temperature} since \keck\ iodine
atlas fits the data very well, as described in the previous
subsection. Choosing a region where it contains temperature-sensitive
lines, we found the best-fit temperature for the \keck\ KPNO scan is
55$\degree$C, although synthetic spectra ranging from 40-70$\degree$C
all fit the data almost equally well and they are hard to distinguish
(column density and temperature are highly degenerate
parameters). \rev{We thus conclude that IodineSpec5 is reliable for
estimating temperatures for iodine FTS scans, at least to an accuracy
of 5-10$\degree$C.}

We then fitted the NIST scan, which has the highest SNR and
resolution among all FTS scans or TS12 spectra (we also have a rough
idea about its temperature). The results are shown in
Figure~\ref{het:fig:nistfit}, where the top panel shows the best-fit
models at different temperatures, and the bottom panel compares the
NIST scan with its the best-fit model at 110$\degree$C, the KPNO scan,
and the \keck\ cell KPNO scan.

\end{figure}
%----------------------------------------------------------------

When we tried to fit the \het\ KPNO scan, the high degeneracy between
column density and temperature hindered us from getting an accurate
estimate for the temperature. Models in 40-80$\degree$C appear to fit
equally well with varying column densities. However, only the fit at
$70\degree$C has the same column density as the best-fit value derived
from the NIST fit. We thus fixed the column
density in our fits for \het\ KPNO scan, and (unsurprisingly) the best-fit
temperature came out to be $70\degree$C. Therefore, we conclude that
the NIST scan was indeed at a different gas temperature, and the old
KPNO scan seems to be at the right temperature.

But how about the TS12 spectrum? Again, using the best-fit column
density derived from our NIST and KPNO fits, we estimated the
temperatures for the TS12 spectra (supposedly) at 50, 60, and
70$\degree$C. The best-fit temperature turns out to be 55$\degree$C
for claimed 50$\degree$C TS12 spectrum, 80$\degree$C for the
60$\degree$C one, and 100$\degree$C for the 70$\degree$C one. The
results fitting for the ``70$\degree$C'' TS12 spectrum are in
Figure~\ref{het:fig:ts12fit}.

%----------------------------------------------------------------

These findings on \het\ cell temperatures could explain the fits to
real data. If the \het\ cell was kept at a higher temperature (e.g.,
$\sim 100\degree$C) instead of $70\degree$C when it was in active use
for precise RV calibration (despite what the temperature control
reported), or if the actual temperature of the gas in the cell changes
over time, then the KPNO scan, which was done at $70\degree$C,
certainly cannot fit the observed data and provide precise
calibrations to measure RVs to the level of \keck, which has a precise
iodine atlas. Looking at the bottom panel of
Figure~\ref{het:fig:ts12fit}, it is not hard to imagine why the \keck\
cell scan provides the best fits to \het\ data
(Figure~\ref{fig:lampi2fit}) -- if the gas temperature is between 70
and 110$\degree$C during actual observations (and perhaps more often
closer to 70$\degree$C), then an iodine atlas which has line depths in
between the KPNO and the NIST scans would provide a better fit, which
the \keck\ scan happens to satisfy.

\rev{Why was the temperature of the iodine gas in the cell higher than
70$\degree$C? We explore potential cause for the rise of cell
temperature in the following subsection.}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{\rev{Cause for a Higher Iodine Gas Temperature}}

Throughout the FTS scans at NIST and the TS12 experiment, the readings
of the temperature probe on the \het\ iodine cell stayed at
70$\degree$C. However, as we demonstrated above, the temperature of
the iodine gas in the cell appears to be higher: 110$\degree$C for the
NIST FTS scan and 100$\degree$C for the TS12 spectrum with the
$70\degree$C setting.

One potential explanation is that the temperature probe was
malfunctioning. It does not report a true temperature but is biased
towards a lower reading than the actual temperature. This has to be
true for both the old and the new temperature probes to explain the
estimated gas temperatures in both the NIST scans (measured using the old
probe) and the TS12 spectra (using the new probe).

An alternative explanation is that the temperature probe was working,
but either there was a temperature gradient in the cell, or the gas
was at a higher temperature while the glass cell stayed cool. These
two alternative scenarios seem plausible, especially as an explanation
for the high temperature of the gas for the NIST scans. As recalled by
Jason Wright, the halogen lamp used for the NIST scan, which provided
the continuum emission shining through the iodine cell, was
exceptionally bright. It was a lamp with a power of $1\ kW$ and the
room was considerably warmed up by this lamp. We discuss the
possibility of these two scenarios below through order-of-magnitude
estimates. We use the iodine cell properties for the \keck\ cell from
\cite{butler1996} for these estimates, because we do not have the data
for the \het\ cell. The \keck\ cell is a Pyrex glass cylinder that is
10 cm long, and 5 cm in diameter on the windows, with a gas pressure
of 0.01 atm at 50$\degree$C. We do know that the \keck\ and \het\
cells are very similar in size and gas column density, so it should suffice
for our order-of-magnitude calculations.


%------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Temperature Gradient in the Glass}

We first see if shining such a bright light at the cell would induce a
large enough temperature gradient in the cell glass (made of
Pyrex) to explain the difference between the gas temperature
(110$\degree$C) and the temperature probe reading (70$\degree$C,
assuming correct). The \het\ cell only has one temperature probe, and
this is true for the old enclosure used at NIST and the new one at
TS12 (the \keck\ cell has two probes: one in the middle and one at the
end of the cell). A temperature gradient in the glass cell could mean
that the heated glass on one side can bring the gas inside to a higher
temperature, while the glass on the other side with the temperature
probe stays at $70\degree$C. To sustain a temperature gradient, there
needs to be a continuous heat input, which would be the halogen lamp
shining on the cell. According to the law of heat conduction, or
Fourier's law (in its 1-D differential form), the temperature gradient
can be estimated via: 
\beq
q = -k \frac{dT}{dx},
\eeq
where $q$ is the heat flux density in $W/m^2$, $k$ is the thermal
conductivity of the material in $W/m \cdot K$, and $dT/dx$ is the
temperature gradient in $K/m$.

The heat flux density coming from the halogen lamp can be derived by
\beq q = P_{\rm lamp} \cdot f_{\rm beaming} \cdot f_{\rm absorption}
/4\pi D^2, \eeq where $P_{\rm lamp}=1\ kW$ is the power of the lamp,
$f_{\rm beaming}$ is the beaming factor of the lamp (as it is not
isotropically radiating towards all directions), $f_{\rm absorption}$
is the fraction of radiation absorbed by the glass, and $D$ is the
distance from the lamp to the cell. For a rough estimate, we assume
$f_{\rm beaming}=3$ (meaning the light from the lamp is filling a
solid angle of $4\pi/3$) and $D=1$ m. To estimate $f_{\rm
absorption}$, we need the emission spectrum of the halogen lamp and
the absorption spectrum of Pyrex. We assume the halogen lamp spectrum
is a black-body spectrum with peak around $1 \mu$m, which is typical
for this type of lamps. The transmission spectrum of Pyrex can be in
found in this website: \\ {\tt
http://www.me.mtu.edu/~microweb/GRAPH/Laser/GLASS.JPG} (or can be
easily found at several other places documenting the properties of
Pyrex). Pyrex is largely transparent in the optical, but it has an
absorption feature near 2.7 $\mu$m and it heavily absorbs UV light
short of 300 nm and IR light longer than 5 $\mu$m. Considering that
there was an UV filter between the lamp and the iodine cell at the
NIST scan, $f_{\rm absorption}$ mostly comes from IR. This fraction
can be estimated by numerically integrate the Planck function for the
intervals $[2.5,3.0]\ \mu$m and $[5.0, \inf]\ \mu$m, and $f_{\rm
absorption}$ turns out to be about 6\% of the total lamp
emission. From these numbers, $q$ is estimated to be 14.3 $W/m^2$.

The thermal conductivity ($k$) of Pyrex is a well known number, as
it is a widely used and manufactured material, and it is about
$k=1.1\ W/m\cdot K$.\footnote{From {\tt
http://www.azom.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=4765, for example.}}

Plugging in $q$, $k$, and using $dx=10$ cm or 0.1~m (the length of the
iodine cell), $dT$ turns out to be about
1.4~$K$. Considering the fact that the light is shining on the window
of the glass cell and then being conducted down the thin cylinder
shell, $q$ may be boosted by a factor of a few
(assuming the thickness of the glass is a couple mm). This
means that the temperature gradient is unlikely to be as large
as $40\degree$C, though not completely ruled out given our crude method of
estimation. However, this amount of heat may not be large enough to
heat the glass from $70\degree$C to $110\degree$C, or even sustain the
high temperature of the glass because of its cooling rate. 

First, this amount of energy from the lamp is probably too small to
cause a significant temperature rise in the glass. Using the specific
heat of Pyrex, $C_P = 0.75\ J/g\cdot K$,\footnote{From
http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/specific-heat-solids-d\_154.html}
assuming the weight of the glass cell to be $M_{\rm glass} = 100\ g$,
and using an input power of $q \times \pi r^2$, where $r=0.025$~m is
the radius of the iodine cell window, the rate of the temperature rise
in Pyrex from heating of the lamp is:
\beq
dT/dt = q\cdot \pi r^2 / C_P M_{\rm glass} = 3.8 \times 10^{-4}\ K/s.
\eeq
Even assuming the glass does not cool, this means the temperature would only rise
for about 4 $K$ in an hour. 

Second, the thermal radiation from the glass alone would cool the
glass off fast enough. At $T=100\degree$C $= 375.15 K$, the thermal
radiation has a power of $\sigma T^4 = 1123\ W/m^2$ -- much larger than
the input energy from the halogen lamp. Even considering that the
glass is wrapped in thermal insulators and only two windows are
exposed to the air, this should still be enough to cool the glass down
fast enough and prevent continuous heating (which would be too slow
anyway, as argued above).

Therefore, if the temperature probe is working, it is likely that the
entire glass stayed at its reported temperature instead of having a
temperature gradient as large as $40\degree$C during the NIST FTS
scans.

%------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Heated Gas within a Cooler Glass}

Next, we look at the temperature of the iodine gas in the cell. If the
gas is heated up to a higher temperature without considerably heating
up the glass, then perhaps the temperature probe was working but it
was only reporting the temperature of the glass but not the
gas. First, the small mean free path of the iodine molecule in the
cell suggests that they primarily thermalizes with themselves and then
with the glass. The mean free path of iodine molecules is estimated by
using ideal gas assumption:
\beq
\lambda = (\sqrt{2} \sigma \cdot n)^{-1} = \frac{k_BT}{\sqrt{2}\pi d^2 P},
\eeq
where $\sigma$ is the interaction cross section of the molecule, $n$
is the number density of molecules, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant,
$d$ is the effective diameter of the molecule, and $P$ is the pressure
of the gas. The iodine gas in the cell has a pressure of about 0.01
atm or 1 kPa \citep{butler1996}, at a temperature of $110\degree$C or
385~$K$, with an effective diameter of about 5\AA\
\citep{JUHOLA1975437,topley1926size}. Using these numbers, the mean
free path is estimated to be 4.8 $\mu$m, much smaller than the size of
the glass cell. This means that the gas is not tenuous enough so that
their thermalization is completely dominated by the glass
enclosure. The small mean free paths of the iodine molecules does not
rule out the possibility that the gas stays at a higher temperature
while the glass stays cooler, since the gas molecules primarily
thermalize within themselves. But more evidence is needed to support
this hypothesis.

First, what is the dominating heating source for the iodine gas? There are three
heating sources for the gas during the NIST scan: the heat from the
temperature controller heater conducted via the glass, the heat from
the halogen lamp absorbed by the glass then conducted to the gas,
and the direct radiation from the halogen lamp. According to the
calculation above, the glass cell probably stays at $70\degree$C, so
it is not heating up the gas to a higher temperature. 

Second, for the additional heat received by the glass from the lamp,
we have worked out that the amount is 14.3 $W/m^2$. This is too small
to heat up the glass, but could this small amount of heat be conducted
to the iodine gas inside and heat it up? There are four outlets for
this received energy: radiative cooling of the glass, thermal
conduction to the rest of the glass cell, thermal conduction to the
air, and thermal conduction to the iodine gas within. The thermal
conductivity of the Pyrex glass is 1.14 $W/m\cdot K$, as mentioned
before, and the thermal conductivity of the air is about $2 \times 10
^{-2}\ W/m\cdot K$. Both are much larger than the thermal conductivity
of the iodine gas, which is on the order of $10^{-4}$-$10^{-3}\
W/m\cdot K$.\footnote{The estimates for the thermal conductivity of
iodine gas comes from Page 36 of \cite{vargaftik1993handbook}, which
gives the value of $\sim 4\times10^{-3}\ W/m\cdot K$ for a gas
pressure of about 0.2-0.5 atm. The estimate of $10^{-4}\ W/m\cdot K$
comes from theoretical values assuming ideal gas, $k=n<v>\lambda
C_V/3N_A=k_B\sqrt{8RT/\pi M}/\pi d^2 \simeq 10^{-4}\ W/m\cdot K$,
where $M$ is the molar mass of iodine molecule.} This means that the
glass will primarily conduct along the glass cell itself, and then a
smaller fraction to the air, and then an even smaller fraction to the
iodine gas. Considering the factor of $100-1000$ difference in thermal
conductivity between glass/air and iodine gas, probably only a $< 1$\%
of the heat input $q=14.3\ W/m^2$ is being conducted to the iodine
gas, i.e., $< 0.14\ W/m^2$. This number would be even smaller if
thermal radiation of the glass is considered.

Third, another heating source for the gas is the halogen lamp, which
is contributing a power of $q \sim 1.7\ W/m^2$ (or $3.3 \times
10^{-3}\ W$, given the radius of the cell window is 2.5 cm) to the
iodine gas. This number is estimated by using the same equation for
$q$ as above, but substituting $f_{\rm absorption}$ with $0.3 \times
0.024$, 0.3 being the approximate fraction of light iodine molecules
absorbs in the optical window $[500,650]$~nm (estimated from
normalized iodine spectrum) and 0.024 is the fraction of energy
emitted the halogen lamp in this wavelength range. If the gas was
heated to beyond $70\degree$C, this would be the primary source of
heating. However, this amount of power is probably too small. Again,
the thermal radiation of a $100\degree$C material is $1123\ W/m^2$, as
calculated above, much larger than the $1.7 W/m^2$ input power. Plus
the iodine gas also cools via band emission
\citep{waser1947emission}. Therefore, it is very unlikely that the
iodine gas was actually heated up to $110\degree$C because of the
halogen lamp.

Additionally, although the thermalization between the glass and the
gas might be slow, it would not be at a longer time scale than
the FTS scan (about a few hours). The specific heat of Pyrex is
$C_P = 0.75\ J/g\cdot K$, and assuming the iodine gas is at
$T=100\degree$C and the glass is at $T=70\degree$C:
\beq
dT/dt = \frac{(\sigma T_{\rm gas}^4 - \sigma T_{\rm glass}^4)\cdot
  A}{C_P M_{\rm glass}} = 0.05\ K/s,
\eeq 
where $A$ is the surface area of the iodine cell, on the order of
$10^{-2}\ m^2$. This is probably a lower limit, because the iodine gas
would also emit band emission which will be absorbed by the glass (in
UV) and the glass would not cool very efficiently as it was wrapped in
thermal insulators. Therefore, if the gas was heated up to
$100\degree$C, then the glass would be heated up by the gas fast
enough to change the reading on the temperature probe.

To summarize the findings above, it is highly unlikely that the glass
underneath the temperature probe was at $70\degree$C while the iodine
gas inside was at $110\degree$C. This means that a biased temperature
probe or a malfunctioning temperature controller is the most likely
explanation for the NIST FTS scans and the TS12 spectra. One possible
scenarios is that, if the heater
of the temperature controller was turned on the entire time, the
temperature of the cell and the gas would have kept rising until they
had reached an equilibrium, for example, with its thermal
radiation. This means the power of the temperature controller heater
was $1123 \times 10^{-2}\ W = 11\ W$, which sounds plausible. This
would explain why all three NIST scans, supposedly taken at 65, 70,
and 75$\degree$C, all look like they were at $110\degree$C.

We believe that the difference between the iodine atlas
and reality as a result of gas temperature changes or differences is the
most likely reason behind \het's under-performance in RV precision
compared with \keck. We outline potential solutions to improve the RV
precision of \het\ archival data and our recommendations for the new
HRS in the conclusion section of this Chapter.

\begin{comment}
This is a very small amount of power, but it seems to be
significant for the small amount of iodine gas in the cell. The
specific heat of iodine gas is around $C_v \simeq$ 2.5-3.5 $R \simeq$
20-30 $J/mol\cdot K$, of typical values for diatomic gas, and we can
derive the amount of iodine from the temperature, pressure, and volume
of the cell, which gives
\beq
\frac{dT}{dt} = \frac{P_{\rm lamp}}{C_V\cdot N} = \frac{P_{\rm lamp}RT}{C_V\cdot PV},
\eeq
where $N$ is the number of moles of the iodine gas, $R=8.31$ is the
gas constant, $P=0.01$ atm is the gas pressure and $V = 2.0 \times
10^{-4}\ m^3$ is the volume of the gas cell. $dT/dt$ is about 2.2
$K/s$, which means the iodine gas temperature can rise by 40 $K$ in
less than 20 seconds (ignoring cooling during this time). In reality,
heated iodine gas will cool off via band emission (mostly in UV and
short optical; \citealt{waser1947emission}), thermal radiation (in
IR), and thermal conduction to the glass. Because Pyrex absorbs UV and
IR light (and the iodine cell is wrapped in thermal insulators), this
means that the heat received by the gas basically all goes back to the
glass. But this amount of heat ($3.3 \times 10^{-3}\ W$) is too small
to heat up the Pyrex glass: assuming the glass weighs 100 $g$, using
its specific heat $C_P = 0.75\ J/g\cdot K$, $dT/dt$ would be $4 \times
10^{-5}\ K/s$. There is simply too little iodine gas inside to do the
work.

It is plausible that during the NIST
scan, the iodine gas in the cell was heated up to a higher temperature
by the radiation from the halogen lamp while the glass stayed at
$70\degree$C. The amount of iodine inside is too little to heat up the
glass, so the gas was able to stay at a higher temperature while
keeping the glass cool. Continuous energy input from the lamp and
cooling of the iodine gas reached an equilibrium (or
quasi-equilibrium) which kept the gas at $110\degree$, which is
determined by the input power from the lamp and the cooling rate of
the iodine gas. This was true regardless of the glass cell temperature
-- whether it was 65, 70, or 75$\degree$C. That is why the three NIST
scans look the same.

However, it is harder for this theory to explain the temperature
anomalies in the TS12 spectra -- the halogen lamp used at TS12 was
much fainter than the NIST one. On the other hand, it is still a
plausible explanation: perhaps because the halogen lamp was fainter,
the gas inside was only warmed up a little, and it was easier for the
gas to cool when the temperature of the glass was cooler. To remind
the reader, we estimated the temperatures for the TS12 spectra taken
(supposedly) at 50, 60, and 70$\degree$C, and the best-fit
temperatures are 55, 80, and 100$\degree$C, respectively.

One caveat of this theory is that the cooling rate of iodine gas has
not been carefully considered. If the gas cools very efficiently --
much faster than the heating by the lamp (2.2 $K/s$), then a
malfunctioning temperature probe would be a much more likely
explanation.

This theory would not work for real \het\ observations, as the lamp is
very far away from the iodine cell in the optical path. We do not yet
have definitive evidence that the iodine gas was at a higher
temperature for \het\ observations, but some preliminary fits on the
iodine flats and the fact that the \keck\ scan gives a better fit
for \het\ data suggest that the iodine gas temperature was higher than
$70\degree$C.
