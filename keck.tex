\section{Conclusion and Future Work}\label{keck:sec:conclusion}

In this chapter, we described our work on discovering and
characterizing two RV systematic error sources for \keck: telluric
contamination and errors in the DSST. 

Telluric contamination...

Errors in the DSST...

In addition, there is a third major RV systematic source in \keck\
data: numerical and algorithmic errors. This is illustrated in
Figure~\ref{telluric:fig:algorithm}.

corresponds to original \keck\ resolution), no Poisson noise. The
errors and trends here are purely caused by algorithmic errors.

In terms of future work:

{\bf (1) Continuing the battle with telluric contamination: } For
redder bands, it is unclear at the moment what the requirement would
be, although some theoretical calculation by
\cite{2016AAS...22713719S} suggests that modeling to 1\% may not be
sufficient for reaching below 1~m/s in the near infrared.

We will try real observation, and see if a priori or floating water
column density parameter works better.

We hope to do a study on M dwarfs, because they are probably worse.

Important for MINERVA, HRS2, HPF2. Crucial for CARMENES, HPF, EPDS, SHREK,
ESPRESSO, SPiRou etc. White paper has suggested improvement on line
lists in HITRAN. EPRV2 has a lot of recommendations. That is the
future direction.

{\bf (2) Searching for a better DSST fabrication method: }

This will be useful for Magellan/PFS.

{\bf (3) Eliminating the numerical and algorithmic errors: } the
numerical and algorithmic errors, I am constructing a new RV
extraction code, which is the topic of Chapter~\ref{chap:conclusion}.
