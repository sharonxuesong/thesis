\caption{Illustration of the effects of temperature stabilization on
  \het\ RV precision, using data on the HD~37605 system (see
  Chapter~\ref{chap:planets}). The RMS of the RV residuals (bottom
  panel) against the best-fit two-planet Keplerian solution (solid
  line in top panel) has dropped from 9~m/s to 6~m/s (grey areas in
  the bottom plot) after implementation of fine temperature control in
  the spectrograph room in March 2008. The pre-2009 \het\ data are
  provided by the UT Austin group.
