\chapter{Improving the Radial Velocity Precision of
  HET/HRS}\label{chap:het} 


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Introduction and Background}

The Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET) is the world's fourth largest
telescope (as of 2016) with a diameter of 9.2 meter (11 meter by 9.8
meter). Its primary mirror is tilted at a fixed angle of 55$\degree$,
which made the telescope extremely cost efficient. The telescope is
located at Mount Fowlkes in West Texas and operated by the McDonald
Observatory. It is a joint project of the University of Texas at Austin, the
Pennsylvania State University, Stanford University, Ludwig Maximilians
Universit\"at M\"unchen, and Georg August Universit\"at G\"ottingen.

Penn State has about a quarter share for the time on HET. The
telescope is queue scheduled \citep{hetque2007}, which makes it
highly efficient in pursuing observations in time series such as RV
observation on exoplanet systems. Its precise Doppler capability is
delivered by the High Resolution Spectrograph (HRS;
\citealt{1998SPIE.3355..387T}), which is an echelle spectrograph with
an iodine cell as the wavelength calibrator. The typical set up for
precise RV purposes has a resolution of $R=60,000$ (sometimes
120,000). The spectral image is captured by 2 CCDs, covering a spectral
range of 4200-11000\AA. It is a fiber fed spectrograph, with choices
of science and calibration fibers and slits with various widths
placed at the fiber exit to provide higher resolutions.

The first planet discovered by \het\ is HD 37605$b$
\citep{cochran2004}, and since then it has contributed to several
detections of exoplanet systems (e.g.,
\citealt{2007ApJ...665.1407C,2009ApJS..182...97W,2016A&A...585A..73N})
and performed \kepler\ follow ups (e.g.,
\citealt{2014ApJ...795..151E}). It has an RV precision of 3-5 m/s
\citep{2009MNRAS.393..969B}, although in principle, it should have
performed at the same level of \keck\ at 1-2 m/s and perhaps even
better because of the additional stability provided by the fiber
feed in comparison to the slit-fed \keck. What is behind the high RV
systematic errors of \het? 

Temperature stability in the spectrograph room of \hrs\ was identified
early on as one of the contributing factors to the RV systematic
errors, and this issue was resolved since the installation of a fine
temperature control system in March 2008 (J.~Bean, L.~Ramsey,
P.~McQueen private communications). The temperature fluctuation is now
controlled down to $\ll$1~K from 10~K. We confirmed the improvement in
RV precision as a result of this upgrade in our analysis with the HD
37605 data, which is illustrated in the lower panel of
Figure~\ref{het:fig:tempstable}. The RMS of \hrs\ velocities with
respect to the best Keplerian fit of the HD 37605 system is 9 m/s for
data before March 2008, and it is reduced to 6 m/s for data afterwards
(see Chapter~\ref{chap:planets} for more on the HD 37605 system). Such
improvement is encouraging, and a closer look at the data and the
intermediate products of the Doppler pipeline reveals even more
potential contributors to the RV instability of \hrs, which is the
theme of this chapter.

We set out to first construct a data reduction and RV extraction
pipeline for \het\ (Section~\ref{het:sec:pipeline}). Then we tried to
improve the precision by seeking out for a better instrumental profile
(IP) model, i.e., a functional form that can bring good fit to \het\
data (Section~\ref{het:sec:ip}). Section~\ref{het:sec:fts} describes
our efforts in validating the iodine cell Fourier Transform
Spectrometer (FTS) scans for \het\ and our investigation on the
temperature change of the iodine cell.

\section{Adoption of REDUCE and the CPS Doppler Code for
  HET/HRS}\label{het:sec:pipeline} 

We built a data reduction pipeline for \het\ that performs automatic
raw spectral data reduction and RV extraction for any target star or
HET observing program.

The first part of our data pipeline is the raw reduction code, which
reduces the raw spectral images with calibration frames and produces
FITS files containing the extracted 1-D spectrum for each spectral
order.  We adopted the REDUCE reduction package by
\cite{2002A&A...385.1095P}. Sarah Gettel and Stephen Bongiorno did the
initial adoption of the REDUCE package for reducing \het\ data. It
involved much parameter tuning with the original package to make
this package, which was designed for slit-fed spectrometers
like \keck\ and Lick/Hamilton, to work with the fiber-fed HRS data.
The most important modification we did was to automate the routine for
tracing the echelle orders on the spectral image, which used to
require human-intervention (i.e., clicking on the echelle orders to
help the code recognize the traces). Capitalize on the fact that the
shape of the order traces do not change significantly across time, we
use a set of previously fit polynomials that describe the trace
positions and shift them to match the traces on the raw image via
cross correlation. We also wrote wrapper routines to automate bulk
reduction for \het\ observation programs or any single target star.

The second part of our data pipeline is the code that extracts RVs
from the 1-D spectral data. We adopted the CPS Doppler code, which is
documented in Chapter~\ref{chap:doppler}. The adoption process mostly
involved bookkeeping and code debugging works to make sure it could
run on Penn State Astronomy network machines, to train
the code to recognize \het\ images, to work with our local file
structures, and to be able to produce DSST locally using \het\ data
(instead of using \keck\ DSST like we did initially, which does not
produce RVs as precise as using \het\ DSSTs). 

In the spirit of making it easier for any future CPS code adopters, we
document the requirements and procedures for making such an adoption
below. Many of these procedures would not make sense to someone who
has not handled the CPS Doppler code before, but they are tremendously
time-saving for anyone who wants to use the CPS code to extract RVs
from their own spectra.\\

{\bf Required files for Doppler reduction:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Reduced, extracted 1-D spectra with both iodine and stellar
  lines. The 2-D matrix holding the 1-D spectra in each order should
  have the format {\tt matrix[pixel, order]}.
\item A log file which lists: observation ID, target of the
  observation, JD, barycentric velocity correction for the target for
  the observation, and nature of the observation (iodine cell in light
  path?). The default log file should be in the {\tt /bary/} folder but
  it can be customized via keywords of {\tt dop\_driver.pro}.
\item A {\tt vd} example file (an IDL save file) which contains an
  example {\tt vd} structure for the spectrograph (see
  Chapter~\ref{chap:doppler} for more details). The {\tt vd} structure
  also contains definition for spectral chunks, i.e.\ their orders and
  starting and ending pixels. It also contains first guesses for the
  parameters for each chunk (most importantly, a rough wavelength
  solution which must be good within 20 pixels). This should be in the
  {\tt /files/} folder.
\item An IPGUESS file (IDL save file) with the structure {\tt
    ipguess}, which contains the JD and file names for the {\tt vd} files
  to be used as first guesses of parameters. The {\tt ipguess} structure
  must contain at least one {\tt vd} file entry, and very often it has
  many entries so that the code can pick the most recent one. This
  should be in the same folder as the Doppler code.
\item A DSST file (IDL save file) with the {\tt DSST} structure, which
  contains the DSST spectrum in chunks, and the definition of chunks
  must be consistent with the example {\tt vd} structure. This should be
  in the {\tt /files/} folder.
\end{itemize}

{\bf List of routines to modify:}
\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt dop\_driver.pro}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Add a keyword to distinguish jobs for your instrument, e.g.,
      ``het=het'' for \het\ reductions.
    \item Add codes to define necessary data paths near line 124.
    \item Add a line near line 406 so that the code recognize the
      first two characters in your observation name, which will be used as
      an identifier for your instrument. For example, the \het\ observations
      are named as ``20160101.00001'', so the identifier for \het\ data is
      ``20'' (it is ``rj'' for post-detector upgrade \keck\ data).
    \item If you want the sum of Gaussians IP for your instrument,
      add this option near line 75.
  \end{itemize}
\item {\tt crank.pro} Near line 164, add instrument setups such as
  data paths.
\item {\tt rdsi.pro} Add option ({\tt tp eq '20'} for \het) for
  reading in the spectral data for your instrument.
\item {\tt chip.pro} Add gain value for your detector, even if your
  reduced spectra are gain-corrected already (then just have {\tt gain =
    1}).
\item {\tt vdcube.pro} Define the {\tt highcts} near line 120 for your
  detector, which defines the saturation threshold for your CCD and such
  observations will be disregarded during vanking. Also add your
  customized {\tt /files/} path in the code near line 168.
\item {\tt rdhbcvel.pro} At the beginning, make sure this code knows
  that it is handling data specific to your instrument (using, for
  example, the name of your log file as identifier). Then near line 80,
  you want to define a full file name for your reduced 1-D spectra based
  on the observation ID.
\item Making your own DSST: {\tt
    /rv/deconv/deconvolve\_stellar\_template.pro} contains the code to
  make DSST using \het\ data. A quick walk through {\tt
    make\_dsst\_keck\_psu.pro} and compare it with {\tt make\_dsst.pro}
  will also tell you how to modify {\tt make\_dsst.pro} to make it work
  for your template observations.
\end{itemize}

There could be other ad hoc places that need to be modified to
accommodate your customized 1-D spectrum format. For example, around
line 523 in {\tt stargrind.pro}, the code defines a lower boundary for
wavelength at 5000\AA, which is completely arbitrary, and the user may
need to modify this to accommodate any orders bluer than 5000\AA. Or,
if you are using sum of Gaussians as your IP model, you want to modify
{\tt getpsf.pro} for customized positions and widths for your
satellite Gaussians.

A typical call to run the Doppler code looks like this:\\
{\tt
  dop\_driver,'target.star.name','your.short.tag',dsstname='file name
  of your DSST', dsstobnm='observation name of your
  DSST', /gh, /vank, /noprint, /het, tag='.your.long.tag'
} \\ 
The previous chapter is a general documentation of how the CPS Doppler
code works. Other useful documentation for the code are in the {\tt /doc/}
folder.

After we completed our data pipeline, we immediately reduced the data
on HD 185144, which is a favorite RV standard at both Keck and HET and
also many other precise RV facilities. The results, plotted in
Figure~\ref{het:fig:sigdra}, were very encouraging -- a 3-4 m/s
precision out of the box, without any tuning of the Doppler
code. It is also found out later that the RVs produced using the \het\
DSST are better than the ones with \keck\ DSST, possibly because the
errors in the deconvolution and the forward modeling (convolution)
would cancel out if the DSST and star$+$iodine data come from the same
telescope, which is commonly agreed among the iodine precise RV artists.

The typical \keck\ RV RMS on HD 185144 is about 2.57~m/s. Our mission
is to find out if and how we can bring the RV precision of \het\ to
the level of \keck.

\section{Conclusions and Future Work}\label{het:sec:conclusion}
 
To summarize, we think that two of the major drivers behind \het's RV
systematic errors are {\em temperature issues with the iodine
cell (or inaccurate iodine atlas which fails to capture such changes)
and inaccurate modeling of the IPs}. 

Overall, the \het\ spectra exhibit more changes than the \keck\
spectra, which probably makes it harder to model and leads to its
large RV systematic error (Figure~\ref{het:fig:chunkvary}). These
variations may be due to temperature changes in the cell or
spectrograph changes such as IP or focus changes. Precise Doppler
spectroscopy requires great care to minimize any changes in the iodine
cell and spectrograph performance. For example, standard CPS \keck\
observations are preceded with a series of procedures which ensures
that (1) the spectrograph is very well focused and (2) the wavelength
solution for the CCD chip stays roughly the same, i.e., the ThAr lines
always land on the same pixels. \het\ does not perform these
procedures, to the best of our knowledge.

chunk, shifted and normalized so that the spectral lines match (using
cross correlation and interpolation; normalized using total counts in
this chunk). The black dots in each of the two top panels are the RMS
values of the normalized counts in each pixel, multiplied by 4 and
added by 0.5 for illustration purposes. The \het\ spectra exhibit
significantly more variation than the \keck\ spectra, and we discuss
potential reasons in Section~\ref{het:sec:conclusion}. The bottom

of the spectrum, which shows that the \het\ spectra have more
variation in both line centers/continuum and line wings than \keck.

%----------------------------------------------------------------

Our adventure in improving the RV precision of \het, though incomplete
and sometimes inconclusive so far, have taught us several important
lessons for iodine-calibrated precise RV work:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The IP functional forms for fiber-fed spectrographs probably
differ quite significantly from slit-fed ones, and it is important to
find a good IP function which not only describes the IP well but also
has good convergence properties for the forward modeling
fitter. Initial guesses on IP parameters could play an important role.
  \item The iodine atlas provided by FTS scans should not be taken for
granted as the ``ground truth''. There are challenges with FTS
measurements and data reduction for measuring absorption spectrum with
such a big spectral span. The cell may also change over time, making
older FTS scans obsolete. Echelle spectrograph with hyper resolution like the
TS12 arm on the Tull Spectrograph is very helpful for validating
iodine atlas or checking cell quality.
  \item It is vital to stabilize the cell to a desired temperature
precisely and accurately, probably at least to
$\pm$10$\degree$C. Theoretical code computing iodine lines such as
IodineSpec5 is helpful for diagnosing problems with iodine cells. One
can imagine that this can also be helpful in identifying permanent
cell change like the one experienced by the Lick/Hamilton cell, which
compromised the usefulness of the spectrograph for precise RV work
fatally\citep{2014ApJS..210....5F}.
\end{itemize}

Looking forward, there are several things which can help solving the
mystery and hopefully eventually leading to an improvement in the RV
precision of \het:

{\bf (1) Determining cell temperature before extracting RVs} for each
observation. It is probably valuable to obtain FTS scans of the \het\
cell at various temperatures and interpolate between them to make a
finer model grids of iodine atlases at different
temperatures. Floating the temperature as a free parameter in RV
extraction is also an option, but the degeneracy it introduces will be
detrimental to the RV precision. Therefore, a better route is to use
the temperature-sensitive regions among the iodine spectrum to
determine the cell temperature first, then use the corresponding atlas
in the forward modeling process to determine RVs. Validating the
iodine atlas and temperature control
stability/reliability\footnote{The cell enclosure and temperature
controller for the \het\ used in our TS12 observations are the ones
for the new \het, which is troubling.} is crucial for the upgraded
\het.

{\bf (2) Finding a better IP function:} This can be first done through
fitting ThAr frames, and then tested via fitting B star $+$ iodine
frames, which would be a much easier task for observations with
pre-determined iodine cell temperature. We plan to continue to explore
possibilities with the modified Moffat function by adding
perturbations and providing good initial guesses.

{\bf (3) Examining the spectral data for modal noise or raw reduction
errors:} We have taken day time engineering data before the HET
shutdown/upgrade to test if modal noise is significant in \het\ data
in very high SNR regime. Although we have calculated that the number
of modes in the \het\ fiber is large enough that modal noise should
not be a concern, it would still be valuable to reduce and analyze
these data to validate this calculation.

More importantly, the upgraded \het\ has great promise in RV
precision, and carrying on these lessons is crucial for ensuring good
RV performance ($\sim$1~m/s) -- especially the lesson on iodine atlas
and cell temperatures. Chapter~\ref{chap:conclusion} has more
on the upgraded \het\ and related future work.
