\chapter{The Carlifornia Planet Survey Doppler Code}\label{chap:doppler}

This chapter contains a brief documentation describing the algorithm
and structure of the California Planet Survey (CPS) Doppler code,
which extracts RVs from iodine-calibrated stellar spectra. As of March
2016, no documentation in published or unpublished form existed for
this widely used code, although \cite{butler1996} describes the basics
for the technique of iodine-calibrated precise RV, and some CPS
publications contain description for certain elements of the code
\citep[e.g.,][]{ 2009ApJ...696...75H, 2011ApJ...726...73H,
  2011ApJS..197...26J}.
