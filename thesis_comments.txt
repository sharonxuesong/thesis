Talk to Paul about HRS.
- a lot of things will affect the IPs.
- they change a lot of things: the position of the iodine cell might have changed, which could affect the stability and precision.
- partial mirror illumination might have worked to their advantage because they didn't have a scrambler before.

hypothesis for the partial mirror 1 m/s:
telescope pupil change -> spot in fiber changes -> pupil fill more at center -> dodging edge of the pupil and thus camera defects at the edge -> better precision.

Add text on alternative explanation for iodine cell temperature rise:

- calculate heating of the glass;
- calculate gas thermalization (between gas molecules and gas and glass);
- more on connecting hardware to software.

Add HD 185144 Vogt et al. tentative planet claim plots to Chapter 4.

According to Sam Halverson, the one they used at their NEID lab peaks at around 1um and has a power of 20W.

Scripts for numerically estimating black body absorption in certain bands:
function bbfunc,x
return x^3/(exp(x)-1)
end
norm = qsimp('bbfunc',0.01,30,/double) ; smaller or larger bonds are unnecessary anyway
kb = 1.38d-23 ; boltzman const
h = 6.5d-34 ; planck const
T = T=2.9d-3/1d-6 ; temperature of BB, assuming peak at 1um
print,3d8/2.5d-6*h/kb/T ; 2.5um converted to integration variable x = h*f/(kb*T), f = frequency in Hz
The rest is easy.
