Talk to Paul about HRS.
- a lot of things will affect the IPs.
- they change a lot of things: the position of the iodine cell might have changed, which could affect the stability and precision.
- partial mirror illumination might have worked to their advantage because they didn't have a scrambler before.

hypothesis for the partial mirror 1 m/s:
telescope pupil change -> spot in fiber changes -> pupil fill more at center -> dodging edge of the pupil and thus camera defects at the edge -> better precision.
