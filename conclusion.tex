\chapter{Conclusion and Future Works}\label{chap:conclusion}

This is conclusion.

%------------------
promised to talk about limitation of the CPS code/algorithm, and the
new RV code.

The work described in the previous sections is all done with the
California Planet Search Consortium Doppler code, which is a legacy
code in IDL primarily written by John A.\ Johnson but with legacy
parts that date back to the work of Marcy \& Butler as early as
1989. It is proven to be able to produce RVs at $\sim 1$
\mps\ precision with Keck data, and is behind the discoveries and
characterization of numerous exoplanets, including the first
Earth-mass Earth-radius planet Kepler-78b \citep{howard2013,pepe2013}.

Yet, this great legacy code has many drawbacks: It is based on a
simple home-constructed Levenbergâ€“-Marquardt least $\chi^2$ fitter
(LM fitter) which has high requirement on initial guesses for
parameters and is terribly inefficient and inadequate in exploring the
$\chi^2$ space. It also has many legacy house keeping parts and
complicated structures that makes it hard to upgrade, adopt for other
instruments, and add new modules and functions.

We have set out to write a new RV code that is built in {\it Python}.
The new code carries on the valuable successful parts of the CPS code
over, and more importantly, built to be highly modular and thus will
be easy to adopt for other instruments or to plug in modern
numerical and statistical tools.

We have completed the structural design and built the core part of the
code, where it fits one spectral chunk using any designated maximum
likelihood style fitter (e.g.\ a better LM fitter, which yield a
smaller $\chi^2_\nu$ value when testing with Keck spectral chunks). We
plan to make it fully functional for the commissioning of MINERVA in
Summer 2015 (see Section~3 for future plans to implement more
advanced tools).

Currently there is a large cry in the RV community for a public,
high-precision RV code which would allow better transparency and cross
checking of results. We have made our code publicly available through
{\tt gitHub}, and we plan to document the methods in peer-reviewed
literature once the code is ready to be released for the greater
community.

promised to talk about new vanking project.

This will also contain work on MINERVA and EPDS and looking forward to
other future work.
